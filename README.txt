Steps to run code:
  - Make sure your machine has Python3
  - Install Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Pydotplus and Graphviz
  - Have the following File/Folder structure:
      - Code
          - train_models.py
          - train_models_no_rent.py
          - demo.py
      - Data
          - full_table.csv
          - full_zipcode_rent.csv
          - demo_data.csv
      - Figures (empty folder)
      - Models (empty folder)
      - Output (empty folder)

  - Run train_models.py (python train_models.py). If everything goes right, this should produce some stuff under Figures, Models and Output
  - Run train_models_no_rent.py. Same as #4
  - Run demo.py. (You may change the data in demo_data.csv to your leisure to see different results when you run the demo)
